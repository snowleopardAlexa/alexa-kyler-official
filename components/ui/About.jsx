         <p>I am passionate about user experience design, user interface design, and front-end development. I believe this passion stems from my longstanding love for art and writing. My comfort and skill utilizing technology and designing / developing user interfaces has transformed my passion into a career.</p>
         <p class="mt-4">For the last 5 years, I have been studying web design and development, performing freelance work, and building personal projects.</p>
         <p class="mt-4">I enjoy combining design part of my work since I can work with visuals, and I like the technical aspect of it which is coding. </p>
